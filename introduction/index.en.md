## INTRODUCTION

In this workshop, you will use Amazon CodeWhisperer to develop application in MERN stack with help of the basics of prompt engineering. MERN Stack is a collection of MongoDB, Express, React and Node, used to develop web applications comprising backend, front-end, and database components. It is JavaScript that is used for the faster and easier development of full-stack web applications.

We will start with basic prompts highlighting how the service is leveraging your comments and existing code for the results. Then you will dive into challenges designed to improve your productivity. In these challenges, we will give you hints if you get stuck. The idea is to allow you to experience complete end to end appication development without leaving your IDE, use the Codewhisperer as AI Coding companion with multiple technology stacks & frameworks and have fun developing.
